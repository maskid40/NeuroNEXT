Project Description
Target Disease:
Investigational agent (drug/biologic/device):
Primary aims of the trial:
Secondary aims:

NeuroNEXT is intended for exploratory studies (including biomarker discovery) that will result in go/
no-go decisions for a future Phase 3 efficacy trial. In 150 words or less, please state the question that you
wish to explore in this trial:
If the proposed study is positive (meets the go decision), please describe what the possible study design
for next study (ex. Primary objective, primary outcome) and how it would differ from the currently
proposed study:
Briefly describe the scientific rationale for the trial:

Briefly describe relevant pre-clinical and/or clinical evidence used to support this trial-addressing the
questions below where applicable (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-NS-11-023.html ):
Which animal models were used for the preclinical evaluation?
Were control animals used during the preclinical evaluations?
Describe the steps taken to minimize bias during the conduct of the preclinical evaluations.
Have the preclinical results been independently replicated?
Is there evidence that the interventional agent reached and engaged the target?
Describe the route/timing of the intervention delivery/dosing.
Describe any clinical data, if any, that supports this study.
Briefly describe the proposed trial design:

you wish to implement: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-NS-11-018.html
If no, has the FDA provided a written exemption from the IND/IDE requirement? Yes No
Do you or any member of the study group have a financial conflict of interest or hold a patent with the
use of the intervention? Yes No
What specific outcomes would make you determine that the investigational agent/biomarker warranted
further study, e.g. a Phase III trial?:!!!!!
What specific outcomes would make you determine that the investigational agent/biomarker did not
warrant further study, i.e what would cause a ‘no-go’ decision?:!!!!!
Have you (or one of the Co-investigators) received past NIH funding for the preliminary work leading to
this proposed trial? If so, please list the grant numbers and titles.
